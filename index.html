                                        This was my first attempt at programming. My main goal was to learn the basic syntax of a programming language. The program itself is a swiss army knife of functions; it includes a numerical, quadratic, area, and tax calculator The control center launches different programs and functions. The calculator is built in C, and I later ported it to python. I finished work on this in summer of 2015 before beginning at Cal Poly.

                                        After learning the basics of C, I decided it might be a good idea to familiarize myself with markup languages. HTML and CSS were the first web-oriented languages I learned. CodeCademy taught me the basics of the Document Object Model, and once I had solid understanding of that I began to think of ways I could apply it. That's when I had the idea of making a homepage that included everything that one might need when getting online. Once I had a basic design, I figured it would be nice to make it user-customizable. Javascript and JQuery came to the forefront of my learning at this point. I began to understand how I could let the user manipulate the DOM in basically any way using buttons and input forms. I'm very pleased with how this project has turned
                                        out so far, and use it on a daily basis.

                                        My first major class at Cal Poly was CPE 123: Robotics. This class was especially useful, because up until this point I had never understood how software and hardware could work together. Over the quarter we learned how to design software to interact with Arduino Uno boards. Our final project for the lab portion of the class was to build a driving robot that could trace a 1 inch thick line with three infrared sensors attached to the bottom. Our second group final project was to think of a useful device that caters to the needs of the elderly. We designed an automatic medicine dispenser prototype that functions based upon the time of day.

                                        This was probably the first time I felt truly stressed out by a school project. The dreaded "Calcudoku" project was part of CPE 101, or "Fundamentals Computer Science". It was one of those projects where you have no idea where to begin, and a week later you all of a sudden think of a way to make it work. The key is to get to that point, and once you do, you have successfully learned your first lesson of computer science: if it doesn't work the first time, sit there for a couple hours and you might think of what to do.

                                    CPE102 introduced object oriented programming. A majority of the class worked with learning how to deal with polymorphism, constructing classes under the object tree, and using “super” to have sub-classes interact with parent classes. One of the more fun projects involved creating a maze game which implemented an explorer, monsters, and treasures randomly placed around a 10x10 grid of squares. I used the show <em>Rick and Morty</em> as the theme.

                                    The gif you see above was an earlier rendition of what this website looks like today. This initially started as a fun little experiment I started one summer day to see how close I could get to replicating the Windows 10 Desktop environment. However, once I realized the potential the project had, I began to devote quite a bit more time brainstorming ways to make the feel of it more genuine as well as adding nifty features that were sort of useful. I posted it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/550goy/i_made_a_windows_10_html_replica_in_progress/?ref=share&ref_source=link">reddit</a>, and to my surprise people seemed to really like the premise. Needless to say, I felt inspired by the support, and now I consider it a side hobby of mine to add stuff to it every once in a while.

I made this application in just over a day, designing every element. And in case you were curious, I did end up getting the job!

                                    This is by far my most encompassing project to date. SpotiFree is a fully functional music player hosted from a Raspberry Pi minicomputer at my house. I use a mySQL database to store song info, and a python script to update the database whenever I add new music. PHP is used to fetch info from the server, and jQuery parses that information into elegant HTML. My goal was to follow Google's material design when creating the user experience. The best part about this project is that I use it every day.
